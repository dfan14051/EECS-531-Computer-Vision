    "Blurring filters are used to average out rapid changes in intensity. The image is blurred by comparing each pixel to its neighbors. This process is done by applying a convolution kernel to each pixel of the image. Some examples for possible convolution kernels include the box kernel, the bilinear kernel, and the \"Gaussian\" kernel."
